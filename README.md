# Notes

This repository contains my notes, highlights, and even quotes from books, courses and other interesting things that I've read or watched. I'm sharing them in the hope that they would be useful to anyone as well.

I welcome you to contribute your notes on the things I added or add new topics entirely! Corrections in any form are welcome.

### Structure

I'll try to stick to this structure as much as I can

- #### Books notes

    Each book markdown file will begin by some basic info like title, edition if applicable, author(s), and a link to purchase or read.

    As well as date started, and date finished to give me some basic overview of my reading performance for a given year.
    Each chapter notes will be listed as an unordered (bullet) list.

- #### Courses notes

    Each course markdown file will begin by some basic info like name, creator(s), and a link to purchase or watch. As well as date started, and date finished.

    Each section (lesson) notes will be listed as an unordered (bullet) list.

- #### Other things notes

    These things may be articles, documentations, interviews, etc.

    A large chunk of these notes will not be organized very nicely, no highlights or any fancy stuff will be expected.
