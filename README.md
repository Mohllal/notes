# Notes

Notes from books, courses and other interesting things that I've read or watched. I'm sharing them in the hope that they would be useful to anyone as well.

I welcome you to contribute your notes on the things I added or add new topics entirely! Corrections in any form are welcome.

### Structure

I'll try to stick to this structure as much as I can

-   #### Books notes:
    
    Each book markdown file will begin by some basic info like title, version if applicable, author(s), publication date, and a link to purchase or read.
    
    As well as date started, and date finished to give me some basic overview of my reading performance for a given year.
    
    Each chapter notes will be listed as an unordered (bullet) list.
    
-   #### Courses notes:
    
    Each course markdown file will begin by some basic info like name, creator(s), and a link to purchase or watch. As well as date started, and date finished.
    
    Each section (lesson) notes will be listed as an unordered (bullet) list.
    
-   #### Other things notes:
    
    These things may be articles, documentation, interview, etc.
    
    A large chunk of these notes will not be organized very nicely, no highlights or any fancy stuff will be expected.
