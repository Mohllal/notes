## Module 1: Should I Start a Startup?

### Before the Startup

- Starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.
- At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. **Just learn**.
- List of things to remember about startups:
  - Startups are very **counterintuitive**: startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. However, *trust your instincts about people*. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."
  - **It's not that important to know a lot about startups**. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.
  - **Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working**. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. But that doesn't work with startups.
  - **Startups are all-consuming**. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here.
  - **Starting a startup will change you a lot**. So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?
  - **The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas**. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

> If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

### Why to Not Start a Startup

- Too young
- Too inexperienced: Getting a normal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to write.
- Not determined enough
- Not determined enough: If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are.
- Know nothing about business: If users love you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't save you.
- No cofounder: All investors, without exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.
- No idea
- No room for more startups: The reason big companies buy startups is that they've created something valuable. And why should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want?
- ~~Family to support~~
- Independently wealthy
- Not ready for commitment
- Need for structure
- Fear of uncertainty: If you start a startup, it will probably fail. Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience.
- Don't realize what you're avoiding: One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two make better founders than people straight from college is that they know what they're avoiding. If their startup fails, they'll have to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.
- Parents want you to be a doctor: So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature requests. Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give them what they ask for.
- A job is the default: Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones trying to get you to stick to the old model. How can Larry and Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't get jobs themselves?
