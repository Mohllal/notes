## Module 1: Should I Start a Startup?

### Before the Startup

- Starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts.
- At its best, starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity. **Just learn**.
- List of things to remember about startups:
  - Startups are very **counterintuitive**: startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you'll make a lot of mistakes. However, *trust your instincts about people*. And in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough. They get involved with people who seem impressive, but about whom they feel some misgivings personally. Later when things blow up they say "I knew there was something off about him, but I ignored it because he seemed so impressive."
  - **It's not that important to know a lot about startups**. The way to succeed in a startup is not to be an expert on startups, but to be an expert on your users and the problem you're solving for them.
  - **Starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working**. Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company. Depending on how broken the company is, you can succeed by sucking up to the right people, giving the impression of productivity, and so on. But that doesn't work with startups.
  - **Startups are all-consuming**. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine. And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time: for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here.
  - **Starting a startup will change you a lot**. So what you're trying to estimate is not just what you are, but what you could grow into, and who can do that?
  - **The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas**. Instead of making a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your mind into the type that startup ideas form in without any conscious effort. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas.

> If you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it. But if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try. Just not now.

### Why to Not Start a Startup

- Too young
- Too inexperienced: Getting a normal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to write.
- Not determined enough
- Not determined enough: If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are.
- Know nothing about business: If users love you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't save you.
- No cofounder: All investors, without exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.
- No idea
- No room for more startups: The reason big companies buy startups is that they've created something valuable. And why should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want?
- ~~Family to support~~
- Independently wealthy
- Not ready for commitment
- Need for structure
- Fear of uncertainty: If you start a startup, it will probably fail. Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience.
- Don't realize what you're avoiding: One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two make better founders than people straight from college is that they know what they're avoiding. If their startup fails, they'll have to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.
- Parents want you to be a doctor: So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature requests. Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give them what they ask for.
- A job is the default: Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones trying to get you to stick to the old model. How can Larry and Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't get jobs themselves?

## Module 2: Generating Startup Ideas

- Most common mistakes founders make when coming up with startup ideas
  - Believing that you need an amazing idea to get started! Great execution matters more.
  - Jumping into an idea without evaluating it is a good one.
  - Starting with a solution instead of a problem. SISP - Solution In Search of a Problem
  - Believing that startup ideas are hard to find.
  - Idea quality score
    - How big is this idea? How big could it be?
    - Founder / market fit?
    - How sure are you that this is solving a real problem?
    - Have a new insight?
  - Bad reasons to reject startup ideas
    - Hard to get started
    - Boring space
    - Seems too ambitious
    - Too many competitors: You should actually err on the side of doing things with existing competitors; When founders go into space with no existing competitors they usually find out the reason there are no competitors is because NOBODY WANTS THE PRODUCT.
  - The best startup ideas are noticed organically.
    - Start with what your team is especially good at.
    - Think of things you wish someone else would build for you.
    - What would you be excited to work on for 10 year!
    - Look for things that have changed in the world recently.
    - Find companies that have been successful recently and look for new variants of them.
    - Ask people you know for problems they want to solve.
    - Look for industries that seem broken and probably right for disruption.

> Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on them.

- When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.

> When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.

- The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up" but "notice.
- Coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious. That suggests how weird this process is: you're trying to see things that are obvious, and yet that you hadn't seen.

> Live in the future and build what seems interesting.

- It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors — so rare that you can almost discount the possibility. So unless you discover a competitor with the sort of lock-in that would prevent users from choosing you, don't discard the idea.
- A crowded market is actually a good sign, because it means both that there's demand and that none of the existing solutions are good enough. A startup can't hope to enter a market that's obviously big and yet in which they have no competitors.
- A good trick for bypassing the schlep and to some extent the unsexy filter is to ask what you wish someone else would build, so that you could use it. What would you pay for right now?
