### Section 4: Domain Modeling

- Creating a conceptual model is the process of identifying the main system's objects generic objects, and describing the associations and interactions between each other.

- Identifying objects:
  
  - Go through the system's use cases, user stories and any other written requirements and start picking out all the nouns to make a list of them.
  
  - Take a pass through the nouns list to find if there is any duplicates or attributes nouns and remove them.
  
  - Make a quick diagram of these objects by boxing each object's name.

- Describing associations and interactions between different object by just draw lines between the objects' boxes.

- Identifying responsibilities:
  
  - Go through the system's use cases, user stories and any other written requirements and start picking out all the verb phrases to make a list of them.
  
  - Identify not just what has to happen, but whose job it is! It's not about showing who is initiating the action but where the responsibility lies for performing it.

- CRC cards (for Class, Responsibilities, Collaborators) are usually written on index cards. Each CRC card represents one class and it has three seconds class name, class responsibilities, and collaborators.
