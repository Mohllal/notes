> Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional.
> There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

### Chapter 1: Clean Code

- The LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never.
- Spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of
  professional survival.
- > We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design. 
  >
  > We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do things right.
  > We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and telephone sanitizers.
  >
  > But the fault, dear Dilbert, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.
  > We are unprofessional.
- Most managers want good code. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion.  It is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.
- The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
- Bad code tempts the mess to grow! When others change bad code, they tend to
  make it worse.
- > A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about
  > it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually they actively break them. They despoil the facade with graffiti and allow garbage to collect. One broken window starts the process toward decay.
- Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.
